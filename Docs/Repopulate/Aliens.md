Aliens make up a core part of the game. They must be bred to ensure the survival of their species after the catastrophic event!

Aliens will have a better name eventually, but until now are simply called aliens.

Aliens are relatively small bipedal creatures, standing between 3 and 5 feet high when fully grown. They can have a huge variety of skin and hair colours, between one and four eyes, ears, antennae, and 2-4 arms/legs. Beyond the antennae, skin varied body part counts, they can appear vaguely human with an overall similar head and body shape. 

Aliens are curious creatures in that every single aspect of their existence is defined by their DNA. Thier DNA dicates normal things, such as hair and eye colour, but also factors such as intelligence, fashion sense, and when they will die - things that in most species would be considered "environmental factors". This allows for a vast and varied gene pool with lots of room for mutation. 

In terms of life cycle, aliens live fast and short. A good lifetime for an alien would be around 8-10 human years, of which 1 is spent as an infant/child, 1.5 as an adolescent, 6 as an adult and the remainder as a senior. This would translate to 10-12 hours of actual game time.

### Planet
The planet Aliens come from is roughly similar to Earth. The surface compromises about 40% liquid water with the remainder being varied terrain of sand, dirt and stone. The size is around 60% of Earth, with similar gravity. The atmosphere is mostly oxygen, with small amounts of carbon monoxide and nitrogen. Like Earth, it has plantlife which can turn the carbon monoxide into breathable oxygen. The planet has two small but close moons, the larger of which dominating the sky and causing frequent eclipses.

One day on the planet is equal to around 6 earth hours, or about a minute of gametime, and is referred to as a rotation. A year lasts 90 rotations, so an hour and a half of gametime, and is called a revolution.
