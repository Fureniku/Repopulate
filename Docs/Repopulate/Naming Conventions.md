Wherever possible, [[Items]], [[Resources]] and anything else should have as complex and convoluted names as possible. For example, instead of water in game it would be referred to as dihydrogen monoxide.

This should just be a running joke throughout the game that the aliens speak with a very complex language, a reference to [Nathan Pyle's Strange Planet](https://www.facebook.com/nathanwpyle2) comic series.
