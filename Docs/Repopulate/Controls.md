Controls for the game depend on your current situation.

### First Person Controls
These controls are for when you are controlling a droid, and are considered the "standard" gameplay controls.

- Your mouse is locked, and controls the view of the camera.
- You have access to a scrollable toolbar.
- WASD: Walk around
- Space: Jump
- Ctrl: Crouch
- E: Open inventory view
- Q: Switch droid
	- With an object for placement selected:
		- Left-click: Place
		- R: Rotate

The player can at any time switch between any available droids in range. It's assumed the ship's AI can control all droids; this includes the ones on the station and any on the celestial body being orbitted. Droids on any body that the ship is not orbitting are out of range for real-time control.
