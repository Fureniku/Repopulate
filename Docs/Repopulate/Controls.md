Controls for the game depend on your current situation.

### First Person Controls
These controls are for when you are controlling a droid, and are considered the "standard" gameplay controls.

- Your mouse is locked, and controls the view of the camera.
- You have access to a scrollable toolbar.
- WASD: Walk around
- Space: Jump
- Ctrl: Crouch
- E: Open inventory view
- Q: Switch droid
	- With an object for placement selected:
		- Left-click: Place
		- R: Rotate

The player can at any time switch between any available droids in range. It's assumed the ship's AI can control all droids; this includes the ones on the station and any on the celestial body being orbitted. Droids on any body that the ship is not orbitting are out of range for real-time control. 

### Ship Movement Controls
The ship flies through space, and has no drag. But we'll gamify it a little bit to keep it enjoyable.

Movements and burns should be slow to take effect but last a long time. As such there's two ways to control the ship:

Option 1: Manual control - for local smaller maneuvers 
This gives you a flying camera view of the ship. Mouse will orbit the ship to view from whatever angle you like, and keys control burners:
**Keyboard Controls:**

- **W:** Controls aft burners for forward thrust.
- **S:** Controls smaller front burners acting as a brake to slow down momentum.
- **A/D:** Controls side burners for yaw rotation (Y axis).
- **Q/E:** Controls top/bottom burners for pitch rotation. (Z axis)
- **Z/C:** Controls side burners for roll rotation (X axis).
- **Shift + A/D:** Controls side burners to strafe the ship.
- **Space + W/S:** Controls top/bottom burners to raise and lower the ship.
- **F:** Input lock; switches between hold to activate and tap to activate/deactivate.

**Controller Controls:**

- **Left Stick Up/Down:** Controls aft burners for forward thrust and smaller front burners as a brake.
- **Left Stick Left/Right:** Controls side burners for yaw rotation (Y axis).
- **Right Stick Up/Down:** Controls top/bottom burners for pitch rotation.
- **Right Stick Left/Right:** Controls side burners for roll rotation.
- **Left Bumper/Trigger:** Controls side burners to strafe the ship.
- **Right Bumper/Trigger:** Controls top/bottom burners to raise and lower the ship.
- **A Button:** Input lock; switches between hold to activate and tap to activate/deactivate.

Option 2: Programmable control
This option lets you input commands to burn whichever thrusters you want for X seconds. This is a little more advanced to use, but the course can be visualised on a map. The player inputs each command alongside "wait" commands; for example, burn aft thrusters for 30 seconds, wait 15 seconds, burn forward thrusters for 20 seconds - this accelerates the ship to a velocity, holds the velocity for 15 seconds, then reduces without stopping.
