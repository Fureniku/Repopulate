Station Modules are generic buildings which attach to the station or its rings. Station Modules are the easiest and best way to add additional space to your station in a very modular way.

The station's shaft itself can host four modules directly attached, or the player can add a ring of various levels. Rings massively increase the number of modules that can be added per level by effectively adding more space for the modules to exist in and attach to. Alternatively, rings can be entire, self-contained prefabs, such as an observation deck.

Modules can be self-contained systems. Once constructed, they can be freely attached or detatched to the ship at will via the external view. A module can be left in space and reclaimed any time later by returning to the same area. Modules can also be sent down to a planet, but cannot leave the surface again once down.

If aliens or other living creatures are in the module when it is detatched, the module will function as its own small ecosystem. So long as there is oxygen generation on board providing sufficient oxygen, the creatures can still breathe. If there is food storage or food production they can eat, and if there is a bed they can rest. 

Modules on a planet can be connected to one another, forming networks the same way they would if attached to the station. This can provide more effective survival for colonies on planets with a hostile or no atmosphere.

Finally, some modules may not actually be directly usable but instead provide things. For example a solar panel or sensor array, which could generate power or improve exploration.

Modules can come in various sizes and have cosmetic differences. For example:
- Standard module (Varied Sizes). A normal module with white interior and solid walls. Can attach a small flat solar panel to the end
- Windowed module (Varied sizes). Same as standard, but cannot have a solar panel. Instead, has a large window in the end wall.
- Observation module (Varied sizes). Same as standard but has windows in back and side walls.


The varied size modules can come in the following sizes:
- 6x3x6
- 12x3x8
- 18x4x8
- 18x4x16

Larger sizes cost more to make, and may block other nearby space stopping other module mount points from being usable.
