Station Modules are generic buildings which attach to the station or its rings. Station Modules are the easiest and best way to add additional space to your station in a very modular way.

The station's shaft itself can host 8 modules directly attached in place of each ring pair, or the player can add a [[Station Rings]] of various sizes. Rings massively increase the number of modules that can be added per level by effectively adding more space for the modules to exist in and attach to. Rings come in pairs, with the modules sitting between the pair of rings. 

Modules can be self-contained systems. Once constructed, they can be freely attached or detatched to the ship at will via the external view. A module can be left in space and reclaimed any time later by returning to the same area. Modules can also be sent down to a planet, but cannot leave the surface again once down.

If aliens or other living creatures are in the module when it is detatched, the module will function as its own small ecosystem. So long as there is oxygen generation on board providing sufficient oxygen, the creatures can still breathe. If there is food storage or food production they can eat, and if there is a bed they can rest. 

Modules on a planet can be connected to one another, forming networks the same way they would if attached to the station. This can provide more effective survival for colonies on planets with a hostile or no atmosphere.

Finally, some modules can attach external parts, such as tanks, sensors, batteries or solar panels, to their outer hull on the base (the part that points away from the ship core). Each module can only support one type of attachment. The other side walls and ceiling (towards ship core) can have different types of material for cosmetic differences, including glass.

## Module Styles
There are a few different designs of modules, for different functions, with different variations.

### Standard/Warehouse-style modules (4 variants)
Standard modules come in two sizes; half length or whole length. A whole length module fills the gap between the ring pair, giving 40x16x28 buildable space (minus a few small unbuildable areas). A half length module fills just under half the gap between the ring pair, and gives 19x16x28 buildable space. Half modules leave space for other modules on the opposing side, but you can't walk between the ring pairs and lose a little bit of space.
Standard modules can also come with a pre-installed horizontal split, adding two layers with heights of 8 and 7 and some pre-installed grav lifts or stairs to move up and down.

### Docking modules (4 variants)
Docking modules come in the same sizes as the standard modules, but there's no split variant. Instead, there are internal and external docks.
An internal dock has a shield door in the base, which can open and allow smaller crafts inside. The half size one only allows very small craft, while the full size module can have medium size craft. Internal docks benefit from much faster logistics loading and unloading.
Alternatively, the external dock can support a medium craft on the smaller size, or large on the full length module - or multiple crafts of smaller sizes. This gives a larger logistical capacity, but the transfer of materials is much slower as materials have to move through a smaller connection.

Both docking modules also have some buildable space, ideally used for storage and logistical systems.

### Corridors and sub-modules
Corridors are a direct bridge between a ring pair, which can have smaller sub-modules attached. Corridors and sub modules cannot be detached like normal modules, only disassembled and scrapped when no longer needed. A typical corridor can support 6 modules (4 on each side), with a module being 8x4x12, and each ring pair section can support two corridors vertically. This gives the submodules a maximum buildable space of 32x8x24 - a little smaller than warehouse style, but more flexible and modular in design, and the initial upfront cost is cheaper (as you can just add the submodules as needed).
These modules are great for things like housing or anything else you want segregated. Buildspace modules can also be swapped out for other utilities such as heavy storage or dedicated infrastructure modules

### Heavy Storage modules
Heavy storage modules are special modules which cannot be entered, and are dedicated to mass storage of a single resource - either a material, or something like water or power. They come in all sizes; both the warehouse style and submodules, with the size directly affecting capacity. These modules also provide better logistical speeds due to only having a single resource when storing materials.
