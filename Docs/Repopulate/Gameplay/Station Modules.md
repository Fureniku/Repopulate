Station Modules are generic buildings which attach to the station or its rings. Station Modules are the easiest and best way to add additional space to your station in a very modular way.

The station's shaft itself can host four modules directly attached, or the player can add a ring of various levels. Rings massively increase the number of modules that can be added per level by effectively adding more space for the modules to exist in and attach to.

Modules can be self-contained systems. Once constructed, they can be freely attached or detatched to the ship at will via the external view. A module can be left in space and reclaimed any time later by returning to the same area. Modules can also be sent down to a planet, but cannot leave the surface again once down.

If aliens or other living creatures are in the module when it is detatched, the module will function as its own small ecosystem. So long as there is oxygen generation on board providing sufficient oxygen, the creatures can still breathe. If there is food storage or food production they can eat, and if there is a bed they can rest. 

Modules on a planet can be connected to one another, forming networks the same way they would if attached to the station. This can provide more effective survival for colonies on planets with a hostile or no atmosphere.
