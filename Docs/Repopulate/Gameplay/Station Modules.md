Station Modules are generic buildings which attach to the station or its rings. Station Modules are the easiest and best way to add additional space to your station in a very modular way.

The station's shaft itself can host 8 modules directly attached in place of each ring pair, or the player can add a [[ring]] of various sizes. Rings massively increase the number of modules that can be added per level by effectively adding more space for the modules to exist in and attach to. Rings come in pairs, with the modules sitting between the pair of rings. 

Modules can be self-contained systems. Once constructed, they can be freely attached or detatched to the ship at will via the external view. A module can be left in space and reclaimed any time later by returning to the same area. Modules can also be sent down to a planet, but cannot leave the surface again once down.

If aliens or other living creatures are in the module when it is detatched, the module will function as its own small ecosystem. So long as there is oxygen generation on board providing sufficient oxygen, the creatures can still breathe. If there is food storage or food production they can eat, and if there is a bed they can rest. 

Modules on a planet can be connected to one another, forming networks the same way they would if attached to the station. This can provide more effective survival for colonies on planets with a hostile or no atmosphere.

Finally, modules can attach external parts, such as tanks, sensors, batteries or solar panels, to their outer hull on the base (the part that points away from the ship core). Each module can only support one type of attachment. The other side walls and ceiling can have different types of material for cosmetic differences, including glass.

Modules can come in various forms and have cosmetic and functional differences. For example:
- Standard module (Varied Sizes). A normal module with white interior and solid walls. Has the most buildable space. Can fit either two smaller or one maximum size in each module space, with a maximum size one also acting as a bridge between the paired rings. These can be sub-divided with interior walls and floors.
- Docking module (Only maximum size). A module which has a docking port on top. Shuttles and other small craft can dock to it. There is some building space for storage, but most space is taken up by the dock itself. Dock modules cannot have external attachments
- Heavy Storage module (Only maximum size). These modules are dedicated to the storing of one single resource. They cannot be entered or built in, and cannot have external attachments, but provide the largest storage options.

The current maximum size for a module is 40x16x28. This provides ample building space for anything required on the station.
