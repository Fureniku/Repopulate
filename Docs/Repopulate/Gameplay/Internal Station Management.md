Internal Station Management refers to building within the station; setting up machines, areas and devices (collectively called Items) to handle various tasks and objectives. This is handled by droids, which the player controls in first person and can freely create more of, and switch between.

Items can be built into a [grid-based system](Building Grid) within modules added to the station. Each module has a grid, and the player then places various items onto the grid. Considerations will need to be made for various factors in certain situations;

- Items may generate heat. Things that generate heat should not be too close together.
- Items may generate comfort or discomfort. This should be considered when building different items together (a nuclear power plant in the back of a school classroom would not be ideal!)
- Some items require other nearby items to function (Again with the school example; a student desk must be in the same module as a teachers desk to function)
- Some items may have specific position requirements; they may only be placeable on floors, walls, or ceilings.

It is possible to place anything anywhere, within the limits of the grid system and any specific requirements. However, the factors above should *encourage* players to build in a sensible way, where their power generation and education systems are separated into their own modules.

In addition, all placeable objects must have at least one area accessible to aliens for maintenance. If an object is entirely blocked off, it may not work (or would not be repairable should it break).

Finally, some objects might require *transport links* with other objects. These can be things such as cables, pipes, or drone paths which move power/data, fluids, and resources respectively. Transport link paths do not block aliens from moving over them, but do use up tile spaces.
