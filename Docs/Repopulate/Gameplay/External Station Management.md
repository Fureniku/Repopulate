External Station Management refers to larger constructions on the station. Primarily these will consist of empty modules to add more space, rings to host more modules, and solar panels for generating power. This is done from a 3D external render of the station, where the entire station (and surrrounding area) is visible all at once. The view, while being 3D with 3D objects, should have a shader applied to still give it a similar pixel artstyle to the 2D internal view.
