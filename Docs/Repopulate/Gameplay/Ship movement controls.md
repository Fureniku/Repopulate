The ship flies through space, and has no drag. But we'll gamify it a little bit to keep it enjoyable.

Movements and burns should be slow to take effect but last a long time. As such there's two ways to control the ship:

Option 1: Manual control - for local smaller maneuvers 
This gives you a flying camera view of the ship. Mouse will orbit the ship to view from whatever angle you like, and keys control burners:
**Keyboard Controls:**

- **W:** Controls aft burners for forward thrust.
- **S:** Controls smaller front burners acting as a brake to slow down momentum.
- **A/D:** Controls side burners for yaw rotation (Y axis).
- **Q/E:** Controls top/bottom burners for pitch rotation.
- **Z/C:** Controls side burners for roll rotation.
- **Shift + A/D:** Controls side burners to strafe the ship.
- **Space + W/S:** Controls top/bottom burners to raise and lower the ship.
- **F:** Input lock; switches between hold to activate and tap to activate/deactivate.

**Controller Controls:**

- **Left Stick Up/Down:** Controls aft burners for forward thrust and smaller front burners as a brake.
- **Left Stick Left/Right:** Controls side burners for yaw rotation (Y axis).
- **Right Stick Up/Down:** Controls top/bottom burners for pitch rotation.
- **Right Stick Left/Right:** Controls side burners for roll rotation.
- **Left Bumper/Trigger:** Controls side burners to strafe the ship.
- **Right Bumper/Trigger:** Controls top/bottom burners to raise and lower the ship.
- **A Button:** Input lock; switches between hold to activate and tap to activate/deactivate.

Option 2: Programmable control
This option lets you input commands to burn whichever thrusters you want for X seconds. This is a little more advanced to use, but the course can be visualised on a map. The player inputs each command alongside "wait" commands; for example, burn aft thrusters for 30 seconds, wait 15 seconds, burn forward thrusters for 20 seconds - this accelerates the ship to a velocity, holds the velocity for 15 seconds, then reduces without stopping.
