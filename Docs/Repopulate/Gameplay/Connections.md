Potential name; RingNet?

Connections consist of two parts; wall panels and floor connections. They serve as a way to move resources around the station and allow for simple routing management. 

Connections can move pretty much everything, although these are handled in slightly different ways;

- [[Energy]] can be routed to modules. Providing a module with energy will automatically provide all items inside with energy. This allows players to turn off energy to entire modules, saving energy as needed.
- [[Oxygen]] does not need to use connection tiles, but is routed between rings through a similar system, allowing oxygen to reach rings which have no direct oxygen generation.
- Storable [[resources]] can be routed, and accept a colour-coding system. For example, you can have a red cable and a blue cable in the same gridspace, while red and blue themselves may connect to different [[Items]] later. All resources can be routed this way for automation of most processes, with further options to request from other items as needed, or fill the current inventory. Resource connections are single direction.

Connection wall panels attached to the centre of a ring open up connections with other ring levels. These work in a similar way to above;
- Any connection marked to connect to Energy will become part of the Energy network. This allows you to power down an entire ring if needed. Dedicated solar rings will always be connected to the Energy network, and solar panels attached to standard rings will always provide power to their own ring even if disconnected from the energy network.
- Connections for Oxygen will balance the oxygen between all available connections. Disconnecting a ring from oxygen with no oxygen generation on said ring will cause suffocation effects to any living creatures within that ring, but may be useful in some situations (for example, a ring dedicated to storage may not need oxygen all the time, only when aliens are performing tasks in there)

Finally, new items being constructed cannot take construction materials from the connections network. These must have resources provided manually by courier aliens.
