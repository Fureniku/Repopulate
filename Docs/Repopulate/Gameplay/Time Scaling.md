Different aspects of the game progress with different timescales. As an AI, time moves differently for you.

In the scale of *solar movement* - how objects move around in space:
- One year (one full orbit if earth was a planet in-game) takes 24 hours of gametime
- One day (one full rotation of an earth-like planet) takes 24 minutes
- Meaning one game year for this example planet is 100 days

In the scale of *lifecycles* - how long aliens live for
- One generation of aliens should be 4-6 hours. Meaning once an alien is born, it will die 4-6 hours later.
- Aliens should be able to reproduce and reach maturity after about 1.5-2 hours
- A functional day is still 24 minutes. Meaning aliens live on a scale for about 10-15 game days
- This gives enough time for players to get attached to some certain favourite aliens and feel sad when those aliens die. They may choose to preserve some for future genetic modifications to increase longevity.
- Aliens will still move around and perform their tasks at a normal relative speed. Their tasks will just be very short (working day will be about 8 minutes..)
