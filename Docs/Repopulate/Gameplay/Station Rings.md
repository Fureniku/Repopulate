Station rings are built in pairs, with the station having enough space for a maximum of 3 ring pairs (6 rings total). Each ring pair is bridged by supports or modules, and each pair can have its own spin assigned (which affects gravity levels).

Rings are comprised of corridor segments, which are separated by module bays. A module bay is where a module or support can be connected. Each ring has four supporting connections to the ship's core, which contain gravity lifts - two towards ring, and two towards core.

Rings can be various sizes, and the size will dictate the number of module bays.

Current sizes are as follows:
Small - 8 module bays. 
Medium (the one we have made) - 12 module bays
Large - 16 module bays
Huge - 20 module bays

New ring sizes are unlocked through research and cost notably more resources for each level. Upgrading a ring is a challenging task; all [[Station Modules]] must be undocked, submodules must be scrapped, and the upgrade process takes some time. The player will have to make considerations for the downtime and make sure the station can function.
