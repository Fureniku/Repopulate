Space [resource](Resources) gathering is much more involved than the planetary resupply missions. You will first need to discover an area containing the resource you need, move your station over there, and then finally harvest it over time. This does provide more resources faster than the older resupply missions to counter the more difficult part of the game, but still takes some time and planning. Also, all resources are now finite - you cannot keep requesting resources because once whatever you are mining has run out, no more resources can be gleaned from it.
