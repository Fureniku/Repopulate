[Resource](Resources) gathering in the earlier part of the game will depend on what resource you require. However, in most cases players can get resources by
[[Story]] **A**: doing a Resupply Request. This basically sends a request to the planet, who will send up a supply ship to the station with the resources asked for. This process takes time, and only one request can be active at a time - but the player can choose the distribution of resources. For example, they could request a shuttle only containing food, or one with 50% food, 40% metal and 10% water. 
[[Story]] B: doing an excursion to planetary remains. This sends an automated mining shuttle to retrieve materials from part of the planet's surface.

Once the resupply shuttle has delivered and returned to the planet, a new request can be made. The entire resupply process should take a few in-game days, which translates to 10-20 minutes playtime.

Once the player explores to other planets, they can either send down mining shuttles similar to Story B, or set up a space elevator. All bodies have a finite amount of resources but the quantity can be detected with high level scans, so the player can decide if it's worth the investment to set up the faster elevator.
