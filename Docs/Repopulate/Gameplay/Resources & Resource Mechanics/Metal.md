Metal exists in two states as a resource; raw and refined. Both are standard resources, meaning they are sourced through various means to increase the amount available, and consuming them will decreate the amount available.

Raw metals only use is to be refined into refined metal. During the earlier part of the game (pre-exploration), this happens planet-side, but is one of the first systems to go during the change into exploration phase.

Early game refined metal mostly comes from the planet. The player can request it as part of their [Resupply Request](Resource Gathering (Planet). During later game, the player must mine it themselves from discovered comets, asteroids, planets and moons.

Refined metal is a key component used in the crafting of most Items, as well as Modules. It is the primary resource for the game in general.
