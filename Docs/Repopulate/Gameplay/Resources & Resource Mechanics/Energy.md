Energy, like Oxygen, is a *constant* resource compromised of generators and consumers. However, energy can be stored as a surplus.

When the energy level of the station drops below zero (more consumption than generation), surplus from batteries will be consumed. Once this is gone, the station will lose power with only essential systems remaining online. This means various production systems and comforts will become unavailable until the problem is resolved.

Energy can be generated from various sources;
- Solar, with either smaller panels on the end of modules, or large panels replacing module spaces
- Bio, which takes biological waste and turns it into energy
- Nuclear, which takes nuclear fuels and water and produces polluted water, energy, and nuclear waste.

Once planetary exploration is available, planetside energy can also be produced, depending on whats available on the planet. The above options are also available.
- Wind
- Thermal
