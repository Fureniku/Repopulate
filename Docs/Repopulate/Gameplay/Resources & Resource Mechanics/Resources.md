Resources make up a primary, core element of the game. The success of the player depends significantly on their ability to manage the resources available to them effectively.

There are effectively three types of resources in the game;

### Constant Resources
Constant resources are [[Oxygen]] and [[Energy]]. These work by simply requiring a certain value to be available at all times. Generators will increase the value and Consumers will decrease it. So long as the sum of all generators and consumers is above zero, you have the resource available.

### Storable Resources
Storable Resources are the main things for a player to think about. These are what will be used for day-to-day life on the station, as well as building an expansion. They include [[Metal]], [[Carbon Nanotubes]], [[Grain]], [[Protein]], [[Mulch]] and [[Water]]. These are a value between zero and however much you have storage space dedicated to, meaning they take up a physical area of your ship to hold.

### Instant Resources
Instant Resources are things which are purely represented in the UI and are used for player/game related tasks. These could be points which can be spent on unlocking new tech or upgrades, or a form of premium currency to speed up build times.
