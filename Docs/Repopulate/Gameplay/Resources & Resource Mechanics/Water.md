Water is a finite resource on board, but can effectively exist in a closed system. The player has the opportunity to recycle all water available forever with the right setup. Alternatively, water can be topped up from Resource Requests and harvesting Ice. Over time, the player will need to increase the amount of water initially available due to processing time in recycling.

Water is used by many things. It is consumed daily by all living creatures and plants, used in algae tanks for oxygen, and potentially more.
