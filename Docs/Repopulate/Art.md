In terms of art, this must first be split into the various views the game has.

### Internal View
This is the main view where the player will spend most of their time. This is a top-down 2D view of the currently selected ring level, with UI for building, editing and alien management.

### Station View
This is an external view of the station, partially for cosmetic admiration and partly for external modifications, such as module management (adding, removing, and moving). This view is in 3D, with a 3D model representing the entire station and immediete space. A shader is needed to slightly pixellate the image, keeping the overall look as a similar art style to internal.

### Solar System View
This is another 3D view, depicting the current system, and is unlocked after Act 2. The player can move their station around in this view to slowly explore the system, or set waypoints to automatically navigate to. There is an effective fog of war, which is lifted as the system is explored - which happens significantly faster with the correct active modules.

### Galactic View
One last 3D view, depicting the entire galaxy. Here, the player can select a star system to navigate to. The player cannot see their ship in this view as it would be too small.
