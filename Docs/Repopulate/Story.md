The core story is split into key parts.

### Prologue
The prologue sets as a mini prequel for the core storyline of the game. In here, we see the initial station get set up for genetic experiments on various animals from the aliens planet. This effectively works as a tutorial, showing players basic breeding and station management.

### Act 1: The Event
The event itself doesn't yet have a name, but it was some kind of space-weather type event which caused the entire planet to become infertile. Due to the radiation shielding on the station, all aliens on-board were unaffected, meaning they are now responsible for the future of their entire race.

### Act 2: The Revolution
After some time has passed, people on the planet begin to hate the stations occupants, and those who were born there and came down to the planet. They believe the station was the cause of the event, with conspiracy theories and fake news running rampant. Resentment gradually builds, with planet citizens attacking space-borne citizens on the surface, refusing to send requested resources, and eventually leading them to declaring war on the station.

### Act 3: Solar Repopulation
The station isn't really equipped for war, so instead the player must research engine technology. The station can now freely move around the current solar system, exploring other worlds and moons, and gathering their resources from space.

### Act 4: Galactic Repopulation
The station can now travel interstellar space, and explore other solar systems. They have entirely abandoned their original homeworld, which will now die out within a couple of generations. At this point, other life can be discovered on other worlds which may lead to substory plots. The game transitions from set story to open-ended exploratory stories.
