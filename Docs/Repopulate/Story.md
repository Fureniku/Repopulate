There are two possible story paths for the game. The starts are different but eventually end on a similar path.

# STORY A
This story assumes the alien species is alive, but war forces the ship away.

### Prologue
The prologue sets as a mini prequel for the core storyline of the game. In here, we see the initial station get set up for genetic experiments on various animals from the aliens planet. This effectively works as a tutorial, showing players basic breeding and station management.

### Act 1: The Event
The event itself doesn't yet have a name, but it was some kind of space-weather type event which caused the entire planet to become infertile. Due to the radiation shielding on the station, all aliens on-board were unaffected, meaning they are now responsible for the future of their entire race.

### Act 2: The Revolution
After some time has passed, people on the planet begin to hate the stations occupants, and those who were born there and came down to the planet. They believe the station was the cause of the event, with conspiracy theories and fake news running rampant. Resentment gradually builds, with planet citizens attacking space-borne citizens on the surface, refusing to send requested resources, and eventually leading them to declaring war on the station.

### Act 3: Solar Repopulation
The station isn't really equipped for war, so instead the player must research engine technology. The station can now freely move around the current solar system, exploring other worlds and moons, and gathering their resources from space.

### Act 4: Galactic Repopulation
The station can now travel interstellar space, and explore other solar systems. They have entirely abandoned their original homeworld, which will now die out within a couple of generations. At this point, other life can be discovered on other worlds which may lead to substory plots. The game transitions from set story to open-ended exploratory stories.

# STORY B
This story takes the approach that the ship is a "backup plan" for the species, who get entirely destroyed.

### Prologue
The prologue shows the construction of the station and the installation of the AI which you control. It functions as a tutorial, and ends with a shutdown of the station as the systems hibernate in preperation for the day it may be needed. A cutscene after the prologue shows a timelapse of many years passing before an event destroys the planet (asteroid, nuclear war, whatever). This event triggers the station's activation.

### Act 1: Restart
The player now has the basic setup, and needs to start building up their resources and life support systems. At this point in the game there are no creatures to care for yet; it's purely a building and preparation phase
During this phase the player only has access to the original destroyed planet and its moons.

### Act 2: Rebuild
The player has enough of a setup to bring creatures out of stasis. They can now start to raise the first generations of creatures; both the prime alien population and livestock. The first generation(s) need close attention, but the player can now begin to automate some tasks including small planetary settlements
The player now has access to the full starting solar system.
### Act 3: Repopulate
The player has had a few generations of aliens now, and they are capable of self-raising. The player's focus now moves more to finding habitable planets and creating settlements. This is the open end of the game now; the player can explore the procedurally generated galaxy and it's entirely up to them to decide on their success.
