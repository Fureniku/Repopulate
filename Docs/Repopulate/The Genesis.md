The Genesis is a large space station in orbit around the planet. The station consists of a very long shaft, which can host a number of [[Station Modules]] and rings. Rings can increase the number of modules that can be attached.

The front section of the Genesis is the bridge, which is where the player can perform ship-related tasks such as movement, course planning and viewing maps.

The station's creation depends on which [[Story]] arc is selected;
**Story A** is that the station was created for experiments on life created in space, which was supposed to lead to interstellar missions.
**Story B** is that the station was created as a backup, and becomes active after a cataclysmic event destroys the planet.

Either way the station serves as a genesis for the restart of the alien's species.
