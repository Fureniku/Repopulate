The Genesis is a large space station in orbit around the planet. The station consists of a very long shaft, which can host a number of [[Station Modules]] and rings. Rings can increase the number of modules that can be attached.

The base of the station serves as a shuttle docking area for resource exchange with the planet. Later in the story, this section is replaced with an engine room, allowing the station to explore deep space, converting the station into a self-sustaining ship.

The station was originally created for experimenting on life in space; with regards to creatures being born in space as well as genetic modification in a safe, contained environment.
