New approach to station design. Previously, it was a vertical pole with rings moving up vertically, and modules attached horizontally. Gravity always pulled down.

The new idea is a pole of indiscriminate direction. There is no gravity within the central pole and the player can freely move in any direction in there. Aliens will use hand rails along the side to move around.
Each "ring" is now actually two rings; upper and lower. Modules connect vertically between the two, and can have either one or two entrances. Some modules may not reach the entire length; meaning you could have two half-modules facing one another.

The rings have gravity, in a way that you are constantly walking downhill along the inner side of the ring
