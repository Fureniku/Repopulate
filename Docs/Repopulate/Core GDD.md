Repopulate is a 3D resource management game. The player is in charge of a space ship/station ([[the Genesis]]), which will grow over time to accomodate more and more aliens living on board. The player also has to manage a breeding program for these aliens, taking genetics into account to repopulate their dying race.

Later into the game, the player can explore the galaxy and attempt to colonise planets. Planet colonisation uses very similar mechanics to station management, with the goal being that planet-side colonies should be self sustaining before leaving.

The general gameplay sees you playing as the station's AI, controlling a series of robots. The robots give you access to first-person mode to interact with the bases, either on the station or any celestial bodies.
